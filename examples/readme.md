# Example Usages

### `basic_bot.py`

The simplest use-case for this package. 2 lines of code.
Plug and play.

### `basic_custom_punishment_bot.py`

Again, nice and simple except it shows off how to use
`AntiSpamTracker` to implement simple custom punishments

### `custom_multistage_punishments`

This will show you how to subclass `AntiSpamTracker` to
add your own punishments. The example usage is muting
on first punishment, before kicking on the following punishment.
