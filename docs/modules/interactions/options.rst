Option's Reference
==================

This class represents the Options for both
Guilds and the AntiSpamHandler itself. It is 
important to become familiar with this dataclass.

Options can be set in two ways:
 - Set when creating a new object ``Options(no_punish=True)``
 - Set using an existing object ``Options.no_punish = True``
