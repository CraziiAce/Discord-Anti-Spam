Abc Reference
=============

This ``Protocol`` simply defines how a ``Cache``
should work. This is going to only be useful if 
you either plan on working directly with an existing
cache or wish to build your own. 

Any form of internal cache is guranteed to implement 
this so you can treat it as a source of truth for usage.
*(Unless you bypass them)*
