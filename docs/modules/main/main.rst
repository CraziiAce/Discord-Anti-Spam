Main Interface
==============

This file deals with the AntiSpamHandler
as it is the primary Interface for you to
interact with.

**Note, this is the main entrance to this entire package.
As such this should be the only thing you interact with.**

Punishment messages won't be sent unless a guild sets a log channel.

This handler propagation method also returns the following class for you to use:

:py:class:`antispam.CorePayload`

.. currentmodule:: antispam

.. autoclass:: AntiSpamHandler
    :members:
    :undoc-members:
    :special-members: __init__
